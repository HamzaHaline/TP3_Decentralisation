### Summary:
This workshop explores the concepts of Data Redundancy and Distributed Computing. It begins by distinguishing between decentralized computing and distributed computing, elucidating their characteristics and applications.

### Workshop Structure:
## Part A: Decentralised Computing

This section includes all files and a demo video pertaining to Part A of the workshop.

The workshop is structured into two principal sections:

1. **Decentralised Computing**:
   - Introduction to decentralized computing and its distinction from distributed computing.
   - Practical exercises demonstrating the transition from local to decentralized computation.
   - Implementation of consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake with slashing protocol.
   - Simplified local balance and slashing operations with a JSON database.

2. **E-commerce - Importance of Redundancy**:
   - Understanding the principles of service and data redundancies.
   - Implementation of a simple hello world server and a DNS registry.
   - Development of an e-commerce API focusing on product and order management.

## Part B: E-commerce - Importance of Redundancy

This section contains files related to the E-commerce application and redundancy principles.

### Objectives:
Understand the importance of service and data redundancies for system reliability and data integrity.

### Exercice Overview:
- Creation of a simple hello world server and a DNS registry.
- Development of an e-commerce API for product and order management.
- Implementation of database storage and adaptation of server implementation to match API requirements.
- Creation of a simple front-end to interact with the server.
- Introduction to redundancy principles through synchronous mirroring and asynchronous replication.

### Implementation Details:
Two different implementations are provided:
1. Basic Implementation
2. Advanced Implementation using synchronous mirroring and asynchronous replication.

### Workshop Exercises:
- Implement various routes for product and order management as specified in the workshop guidelines.
- Create database storage for the implemented routes.
- Develop a simple front-end to interact with the server.
- Simulate API server and database failures and fix the issues.
- Implement redundancy mechanisms such as synchronous mirroring and asynchronous replication with two different database structures.
